Coral C Constraint Checker
----------------------------------
CORAL [1] is a Java based floating point constraint checker for the Java language. However I'm interested in using it to solve Constraints for the C programming language.
There is a direct correspondance between int,long,float and double data types between x86_64 C and Java which means in principle CORAL can be used directly without modification (in fact 
that's all I can do as I can't find the source code for CORAL).

To test this two programs have been written:

coralccc : Is a C++ program that generates C code from the input constraints and solution generated by CORAL. It's purpose is to verify that the solution given by CORAL does
           solve the constraints in C as well. It uses flex to generate a tokeniser and bison to generate a parser. Run with arguments to see the usage message.


coralw : Is a bash script that wraps CORAL and coralccc in a simple to use interface. Run without arguments to see the usage message.
